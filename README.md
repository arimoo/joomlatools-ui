# Joomlatools UI

**This software is not released yet. Things might change!**

[Joomlatools UI](https://www.joomlatools.com/developer/ui) is an intuitive User Interface that can be used on top of the Joomla administrator.
It is not a Joomla template and therefore does not work with the joomla markup out-of-the-box.
All markup should be copy-pasted from this styleguide.
